I told her I was throwing a Barbie themed bachelorette weekend and she knocked the theme out of the park with Barbie d√©cor in our glamping tent! All the girls especially the bride to be were so impressed and we enjoyed our first glamping experience so much! I highly recommend Glamping WNY and will most definitely be using them again in the future!",

Also very flexible with drop off and pickup times. She was able to do two different themes for them since they are into different things. The beds were very comfortable and everything was clean and organized. The kids loved it. It was a great experience. Thank you for making their birthday extra special!",

Their product is clean, unique and they take the time to make every display perfect. My daughter loved having the unicorn themed tents to celebrate her birthday and Holly even included a special unicorn gift just for her. Great product, great company and I can't wait to work with them again.",

They were very communicative leading up as there was a chance of rain. The seating and decorations were SO cute! Holly and her husband got everything set-up quickly and then came after and got it all that night. I have raved about them to everyone and look forward to working with them again!",
