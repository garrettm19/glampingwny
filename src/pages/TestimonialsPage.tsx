I told her I was throwing a Barbie themed bachelorette weekend and she knocked the theme out of the park with Barbie dÃ©cor in our glamping tent! All the girls especially the bride to be were so impressed and we enjoyed our first glamping experience so much! I highly recommend Glamping WNY and will most definitely be using them again in the future!",

Also very flexible with drop off and pickup times. She was able to do two different themes for them since they are into different things. The beds were very comfortable and everything was clean and organized. The kids loved it. It was a great experience. Thank you for making their birthday extra special!",
