          answer: "We are pet friendly, however your pets must be very well behaved. If your pets like to chase wildlife, the bell tent will NOT contain them in the tents. Pets should never be left unattended in the tent. Any damages due to pet or human alike, are subject to damage charges. Please notify us if you will be having your furry friends join you. The pet fee is $20 for the first pet and $30 for the second. Maximum is 2 pets."

          question: "What should I know about pets and outdoor setups?",
